    description="If you haven’t heard about Codebar yet, it’s a wonderful charity that helps build a diverse tech community by offering free regular programming workshops for minority groups in tech. Over the past year, I’ve had the pleasure of being a tutor and presenter at several Codebar workshops in Shanghai. Today, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve joined the team of Codebar organizers. I’ve witnessed firsthand the incredible impact Codebar has on female and underrepresented coders, and I’m proud to step into this larger role."
