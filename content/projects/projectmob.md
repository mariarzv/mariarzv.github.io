At RoboticPlus in Shanghai, one of the most memorable projects was development of a mobile platform-based robotic arm assembly for construction tasks. We focused on integrating SLAM and computer vision systems to improve fabrication precision. We also integrated stereo vision for precise 3D mapping and merged 2D data with LIDAR for enhanced perception. ROS was instrumental in ensuring seamless communication and efficient operation planning.
